## Musical Instrument
This musical instrument was made specifically to play the Megalovania soundtrack from Undertale. There are 12 notes in total and 4 buttons play them. 3 buttons are used to play notes, while the 4th is used to iterate through the arrays of notes and note durations to change how the other 3 buttons behave. So if I press press the 4th button the 3 buttons will become different notes.

## Challenges
Unfortunately it wasn't very practical (or maybe it was and I'm just bad at playing instruments) so in the code I have only used 6 of the notes. I was also trying to play with the keyboard but it wasn't working until I realized (too late!) that I needed Processing to communicate with Arduino for keyboard input. I kept playing with the Serial and made the serial input play out the whole melody.

This is a comparison video between how I play it and how it should sound like if you're good at playing instruments.

The Art was made using both Aseprite & Processing. Sound effects are homemade. Song is my own editing of a TV show soundtrack. Credits go to Joseph from the IM class for inspiring the side scroll code, to Etienne Jacob for his amazing tutorials on procedurally generated art https://necessarydisorder.wordpress.com/, and to Brandon Sanderson for inspiring the physics of this game through his fantasy world in Mistborn.

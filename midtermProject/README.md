# October 13th:
Started brainstorming for a game. Decided to do something that will help me practice my pixel art. 
  - Whatever game I make, I know it will have collisions, so I just watched videos about it.
  - I reread the documentation about making a 2D Mario Game on Processing  http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/test/PjsGameEngine/docs/tutorial/mario.html

# October 15th:
I don't think I have the time to overthink a new game so I think I'll revisit a prototype from last year. Today I rewrote the code of my "Mistborn" prototype to include game states and added a pause menu with buttons I drew last semester. I had initially planned 3h tops for this but it took me a solid 7h because of how unflexible my code was.

# October 18th:
Nevermind, the Mistborn prototype is ugly. It feels pointless and has no aesthetic. And I don't like how the code is written, it doesn't feel fresh in my mind. I think I'll make a whole new Mistborn game. I'll keep the same ideas I used during the brainstorming phase & I'll probably use libraries to save some time. For now I started working on the sprites for my main character by editing some poses I found from some other games' sprites (Fire Emblem, Legault).

# October 19th: 
Finished the sprite animations for the push mechanic & the coin throw. I still need to do the running, jumping, and pull mechanic.

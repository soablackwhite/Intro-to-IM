## October 13th:
Started brainstorming for a game. Decided to do something that will help me practice my pixel art. I think I'm gonna make game that takes its mechanics from my favourite fantasy saga: Mistborn. I tried doing that last year but I was still missing some parts and had occasional bugs.
  - Whatever game I make, I know it will have collisions, so I just watched videos about it.
  - I reread the documentation about making a 2D Mario Game on Processing  http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/test/PjsGameEngine/docs/tutorial/mario.html

## October 15th:
I don't think I have the time to overthink a new game so I think I'll revisit a prototype from last year. Today I rewrote the code of my "Mistborn" prototype to include game states and added a pause menu with buttons I drew during the summer. I had initially planned 3h tops for this but it took me a solid 7h because of how unflexible my code was.

## October 18th:
Nevermind, the Mistborn prototype is ugly. It feels pointless, sluggish, and it has no aesthetic. I also don't like how the code is written, it doesn't feel fresh in my mind. I think I'll make a whole new Mistborn game. I'll keep the same ideas I used during the brainstorming phase & I'll probably use libraries to save some time. For now I started working on the sprites for my main character by editing some poses I found from some other games' sprites (Fire Emblem, Legault).

## October 19th: 
Finished the sprite animations for the push mechanic & the coin throw. I still need to do the running, jumping, and pull mechanic.

## October 20th:
I've been trying to make a side scroller using a pre-made game but I don't know how to "move" the screen while also moving objects. "Translate" has been very tricky, and just moving the background wouldn't affect the procedurally generated objects. I'm taking a break and working on sprites only.

## October 21st:
Got done with the sprites for running/jumping/pushing.

## October 22nd:
Made a cool background using processing that would suit the Mistborn theme.

## October 24th:
Finished animation & movement code as well as the "pull/push" interaction on metal objects. Left: collision check, side scroll, game states, enemy chaser, dialogue boxes, sound & music.

## October 25th:
Spent way too long trying to code collisions, I finally figured it out by making an entirely new sketch with just squares and implementing collisions in it.

## October 26th:
Implemented side scrolling, push/back mechanic, and created enemy chaser.

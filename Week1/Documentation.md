# Difficulties
I'm sort of well acquainted with processing, so this was less about familiarizing myself and more about refreshing my memory. But it was fun! I first went looking for complicated and advanced functions to do this but it turns out there's a lot to do with just geographical shapes that works pretty neat! The beanie is sort of my signature outfit, but also a very convenient excuse for me not to work on the hair (I really couldn't figure out how to use code for messy hair, especially if I'm just using geometrical shapes).

One thing I found difficult though, was the organization of my code. I think this is due to the nature of the assignment. There was no hierarchy under which I could organize the blocks of code, which made it very unreadable to me (even with comments). Because every line served the same purpose as another (that of drawing an element lambda), it was tough to keep track of where every block of code was and what it did.

# It even looks better than the original!

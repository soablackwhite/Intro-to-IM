I'm sort of used to processing since I've used it for other projects, so this was less familiarizing myself and more refreshing my memory. But it was fun! I first went looking for complicated and advanced functions to do this but it turns out there's a lot to do with just geographical shapes that works pretty neat! The beanie is sort of my signature outfit, but also a very convenient excuse for me not to work on the hair (I really couldn't figure out how to use code for messy hair, especially if I'm just using geometrical shapes).

# Final result

# It even looks better than the original!

## Final Project
I'm still unsure what I want to do, there are many interesting concepts to explore: visual representations of music, haptics, 3D Physics, and arduino as more than just a controller. I'll think this over during the weekend.

## Idea 1: Maze Horror

## Idea 4: Working on Midterm

## Idea 5:
#### Plan/Original idea:
I ended up going with something completely different. I wanted to make a 3D game with procedurally generated environment that interacts with the player's real-life environment. The original plan was to have a sort of flying simulator that tells the story of Appa from Avatar: The Last Airbender. In this simulator, the player would incarnate Appa, the flying Bison, and explore the desert in search of his master. They will have to explore the desert and interact with objects to find cues about their master's location. This was supposed to involve collision with the physical terrain, and a way to move objects towards the player as their pressed the movement buttons. Each cue would play a memory (video) from the TV Show to create a sense of melancholy, after which the player will have to follow the direction that the compass (physically represented as a servo motor) points towards. To accentuate the immersion I wanted to add a sound visualizer that would take the sounds from the player's room, & visualize it by a processing sound analyzer, then represented as a 2D supershape (see my previous processing homework). Additionally, the lighting of the game would depend on the player's room lighting.


#### Final execution:
For time considerations these are the ideas implemented and the ideas dropped:

##### Implemented:
- Background soundtrack visualizer instead of room sound feedback
- Procedurally generated terrain
- Changing lighting, even for the background image
- Camera movement (technically not camera movement, will explain this in README)
- 3D model movement
- Visualizer feedback from potentiometer
- Coloring of 3D model (half done)

##### Dropped:
- Room sound feedback
- Collision with terrain
- Collectible objects
- Video memories
- Servo motor compass

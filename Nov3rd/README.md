## Game: Attack of the red LEDs:
- 2x Red LED
- 1x RGB LED
- 6x 330 Ohms Resistor
- 2x Momentary Switch

### Instructions
The program is a mini game where the player must defeat the enemies by attacking them. Both the player and the enemies have health points represented by LEDs. The brighter the enemy LED, the higher its HP. As for the player's RGB LED, its color is at maximum blue value when the player is at full health, and as it gets lower, the blue value slowly diminishes and the red value becomes higher. In short, blue means high HP, and red means low HP for the player. 

### Win/Lose
The game stops when either the player or the enemy reaches 0 health. If the player wins, the RGB LED will flicker with random RGB colors. If the player loses, their LED will remain red. The player can restart the game by pressing both attack buttons at the same time.
